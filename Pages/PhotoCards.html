  <p> My siblings and I made these PhotoCards because we wanted to thank the people who came to the funeral in person. We thought it would be a good idea because Alejandro REALLY liked Kpop. We printed a lot of cards, and we wrote messages on the back of themk to show how thankful we were.</p>
  <p> If you did not know, PhotoCards are a very common thing for Kpop idols to have. They would print themselves on a card and sell it and people would collect them. Think of them like basball cards or basketball cards.</p>

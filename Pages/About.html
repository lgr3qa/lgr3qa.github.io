  <h2>About Alejandro</h2>
  <p>Alejandro Romulo was born February 21st, 1999. He was one of four childrem, him being the second child and first son. His parents Rodrigo Romulo and Cristina Romulo. He was born in Manila, Philippines where he was raised for his early childhood, then moved to the United States in 2004.</p>
  <p>This man is my brother. He was grumpy, stubborn, hard-to-wake-up, a little mean, a bit lazy, and pretty goofy. Despite all that, he was one of the best people that I, and many others, have known. He was loved by many, surrounded by people who cared about him. He made sure that to make people know that he cared about them, despite his prickly exterior. </p>
  <p>Alejandro had this energy about him that would draw others in. He was very inclusive and had built a strong community of friends that he found a home in. His friends at Virginia Tech even called him Papa because they felt like he was everyone's dad. He made everyone feel included and always had many people go in and out of his house as if it were a ranch.</p>
  <p>We lost him due to suicide in September 2023. No one expected it. No one spotted any signs. Anytime I would ask how he was doing, he would respond with "umm, I'm fine I guess" or an "ehhh."  He masked his inner thoughts with ease. My siblings and I had no idea what he was going through and neither did his friends who were with him almost everyday. I am so incredibly proud of him for fighting a good fight for as long as he could have, but I regret that I did not do anything to help him out. </p>
